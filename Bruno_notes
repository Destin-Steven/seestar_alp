On linux:

navigate to https://github.com/usebruno/bruno
select download bruno: https://www.usebruno.com/downloads
I selected the Ubuntu/Debian binary to download (about 71MB .deb file) and installed

I forked the project on github
Then I cloned it locally.

edited device/config.toml to use 
  name = "Seestar MattC"
  ip_address = "seestar.local"

installed relevant packages in requirements.txt using pip3 at the command line

Navigated to the device folder of seestar api and ran python3 app.py

In Bruno, I needed to open the Seestar folder below 'bruno' folder, *Not* import the .json in the root
Under "Environment" in upper right, I selected "Device 1" as there is only one unit active.

Quick start to test running an existing command:
On left, expanded "Get info" and selected action-get_device_state
Then ctrl-enter to run the command

To create a new command:
- Can clone an existing one and rename/redit it by right-clicking on it in the left column
- Click "+" in window on right.  This creates a new tab and brings up a dialog box
- Add a new name and select "Put" from dropdown.
- In field next to "Put" add: {{base_url}}/api/v1/telescope/{{dev_num}}/action
- Under Body add 4 parameters with Key names of Action, Parameters, ClientID, ClientTransactionID
- For values for each use method_sync, <a seestar json packet>, 1, 999
- Under Headers add 2 headers with Name Content-Type and Accept.
- For Value, use application/x-www-form-urlencoded and application/json
- Ctrl-E or the -> arrow in the upper right will run the command.
